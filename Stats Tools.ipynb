    "The following monolithic source is the set of all core statistical techniques covered in Devore. A thorough, complete understanding of all of these techniques, in terms of applications, understanding of limitations, reprovability, etc., is a rigorous background for a classical statistician---effectively a BS in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "My interest, however, is in data science, not classical statistics *per se*. The techniques of data science are far too broad for it to be useful for me to constrain myself only to the techniques listed below. But I think it *is* necessary, at this juncture, to have a survey understanding of these techniques and their applications. I leave rigorous full-spectrum understanding to a generalized confidence in my mathematical maturity, that is, my ability to grasp and reprove the mechanics of the tests and techniques below given a *strong need* to do so."
